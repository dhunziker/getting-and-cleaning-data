# getting-and-cleaning-data

This repository contains the solution for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. All the code required to create the `tidy_data_set.txt` is available in the `run_analysis.R`.

In order to rerun the script, please first [download](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and extract the data. The zip file contains a directory which should be extracted as is to the same location these instructions are located. If required, that location can be adjusted by changing the value of the `baseFolder` variable on the 3rd line of the script.

Details on all the steps of the analysis as well as the variables and data types to expect can be found in the related `CodeBook.md`.
